Amy Holt & Nick Teets

### Project Requirements:

#### Goals

* Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Separate business-logic code from view-related code
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

#### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable — not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

* Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
* Allow the user to start a new game
* Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
* Create multiple rounds of difficulty (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc.).

#### Code organization

* Your game should make use of at least two classes, the exact number will depend on which game you choose and your design choices.
* You should use inheritance with your classes. (i.e. a parent class should have properties that might be shared by several other child classes. The child classes should inherit those properties from the parent class.)
* Each class should have its own file with the filename capitalized. The class should be capitalized as well. Only code that is a part of this class should be in this file.

#### Testing

Each javascript file in your project should have it’s own test file e.g. if you have a MasterChief.js class file, all the tests for that class should be located in MasterChief-test.js
